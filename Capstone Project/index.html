    <img src="./assets/images/profile.jpg" height="200"/>
    <h2> Summary</h2>
    <p>I have worked as a COBOL analyst programmer developing commercial ERP systems for the past 30 years. 
    </p>

    <p>Technology is a fickle beast and an unfortunate combination of a market downturn and evolving skillsets has resulted in my needing to seek new pastures.</p>

    <p>I am now embarking on a new, more contemporary path to broaden my horizon into web development.</p>

    <h2> Work Experience</h2>
    <h3><p>Fordingbridge Plc 1979 to 1992:</p></h3>
    <p>Fordingbridge Plc is a small, family run business that manufacturers capital items for the commercial horticultural industry.  I worked my way up through most elements of the business until becomming sales manager.

        <li>Purchase ordering</li>
        <li>Dispatch</li>
        <li>Sales</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Realtime Package Systems Ltd. (Disolved 2010) 1994 to 2002:</h3>
    <p>Following redundancy from Fordingbridge Plc, I retrained and worked for Realtime Package Systems as a COBOL developer.  The company wrote bespoke ERP software on Unix and Linux platforms that targeted the commercial pharmaceutical industry.   
    </p>
    <p>Being a very small company I also provided remote support for customers to address print spooling and other system issues.

    <p>Redsky IT is part of the global JDM Technology Group and one of the leading suppliers of ERP solutions to the UK construction industry.   
    </p>
    <p>I worked as a COBOL developer on a Linux platform and was also responsible for the maintenance and enhancement of many of the shell scripts used for the source code control system.
    </p>
    <p>Although coding predominently in COBOL, embedded SQL featured strongly as the product evolved and in more recent years, XML, for web compatibility.
    </p>

          <li>Purchase</li>
          <li>Payroll</li>
          <li>Purchase Ordering</li>
        </ul>
        Also construction industry specific ledgers:
        <ul>
          <li>Contract</li>
          <li>Subcontractor</li>
